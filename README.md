# VideoJS-1

My first attempt to play with video.js.

I want it to be a video player with collecting functions.

## Thanks to

The original code is from following example

> # Video.js Default Skin
>
> A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/heff/pen/EarCt](https://codepen.io/heff/pen/EarCt).
>
> This is the base skin of Video.js that can be modified to make custom skins.

> The great thing about Video.js skins is they work in both HTML5 video AND Flash!
